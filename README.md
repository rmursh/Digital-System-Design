# Digital-System-Design
Minimization and synthesis of combinational logic and finite state machines. Synthesis of synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits. Principles of control design. Basic concepts in design for testability. The laboratory experiments involve the design and testing of digital systems using small and medium scale integrated circuits. CAD software is used in the design process.
